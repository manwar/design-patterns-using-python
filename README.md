## Design Patterns using Python3

Playing with `Design Patterns` using `Python3`. This is my attempt to showcase recently acquired `Python` skill.

1. [Singleton](https://github.com/manwar/design-patterns-using-python/tree/master/01-singleton/README.md)
2. [Factory](https://github.com/manwar/design-patterns-using-python/tree/master/02-factory/README.md)
2. [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/manwar/design-patterns-using-python/tree/master/03-abstract-factory/README.md)

     6. Observer
     7. Proxy
     8. Template
     9. Filter
    10. Bridge
    11. Iterator
    12. Prototype
    13. Data Access Object

## Commonly Used Keywords:
### Interface
     An interface generally defines the set of  methods that an instance of a class that
     has that interface could respond to.

     It defines  a set of methods, the class that implements it "repeats" the same methods,
     but provides definition, so  interface looks like skeleton of the class.

### Abstract Class
     An abstract class is a class that  contains at least one abstract method. An abstract
     method is  a method  that is declared, but not implemented in the code.

### Concrete Class
     A concrete class is a class  that  has an implementation  for all of its methods.
     They cannot have any unimplemented methods. It  can also extend an abstract class
     or implement an interface as long as it implements all their methods.
