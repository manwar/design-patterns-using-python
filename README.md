## Commonly Used Keywords:
### Interface:
***

An interface generally defines the set of  methods that an instance of a class that has that interface could respond to.

It defines  a set of methods, the class that implements it "repeats" the same methods, but provides definition, so  interface looks like skeleton of the class.

### Abstract Class:
***

An abstract class is a class that  contains at least one abstract method. An abstract method is  a method  that is declared, but not implemented in the code.

### Concrete Class:
***

A concrete class is a class  that  has an implementation  for all of its methods. They cannot have any unimplemented methods. It  can also extend an abstract class or implement an interface as long as it implements all their methods.
